# Password Protection Setup

## 🔐 Overview

The voter board is now protected by a password splash page that prevents unauthorized access.

## 🛡️ How It Works

### Authentication Flow:
1. **User visits site** → Shows password prompt
2. **Enters correct password** → Gains access to board
3. **Session remembered** → No re-entry needed during session
4. **Can logout** → Returns to password prompt

### Password Management:
- **Default Password**: `hackreation2025`
- **Environment Variable**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BOARD_PASSWORD`
- **Customizable**: Change in `.env.local`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change Password:
Edit `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOARD_PASSWORD=your_new_password
```

### Features:
- ✅ **Session Storage** - Remembers authentication
- ✅ **Form Validation** - Requires password input
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Shows incorrect password message
- ✅ **Logout Option** - Clear authentication
- ✅ **Loading State** - Smooth user experience
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices

## 🎨 User Interface

### Splash Page:
- Clean, professional design
- Voter board branding
- Password input field
- Access button
- Security messaging

### Authenticated State:
- Small header bar showing authentication status
- Logout button for easy exit
- Normal board functionality

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Implementation:
- **Client-side authentication** (suitable for basic access control)
- **Session-based** (clears on browser close)
- **No server-side validation** (password visible in frontend code)

### For Production:
Consider upgrading to:
- Server-side authentication
- Encrypted password storage
- User accounts with different roles
- JWT tokens for session management

## 🚀 Usage

### For Users:
1. Visit the voter board
2. Enter password: `hackreation2025`
3. Click "Access Board"
4. Use the board normally
5. Click "Logout" when done

### For Administrators:
- Change password in environment variables
- Monitor access through browser dev tools
- Update password as needed for security
